Hey there, fellow code enthusiasts and AI wranglers! üñêÔ∏èü§ñ You know that feeling when you're knee-deep in a project, trying to get multiple AI models to play nice in your browser? Yeah, I've been there. Cue the frustrated sighs, the endless searches over GitHub issues üò¢, and the "why-isn't-this-working" hair-pulling sessions.

After one too many nights wrestling with backends, CORS issues, and the general chaos of integrating various AI APIs, I decided enough was enough. There had to be a simpler way, right? Something that didn't require installing a bunch of npm builds, juggling APIs, or managing a backend server farm just to get a chatbot running on a static page.

Turns out, there wasn't a simple solution ‚Äì shocking, I know. So, armed with nothing but sleeplessness and caffeine, I decided to build it myself. Enter API-LLM-Hub: my first rodeo in JavaScript packaging and a testament to what happens when a Python AI nerd ventures into the wild west of front-end development. It's been a painful journey figuring out things which I have kept stalling all through my undergrad. But hey, if I can wrangle this into existence while learning what a promise is, I can probably claim 'Full-Stack' on my resume now! üç™üíªüöÄ

## The Spark of Inspiration

Ever tried juggling multiple AI APIs in a browser? üòÉ 

It's about as fun as catching Zapdos with a normal ball in FireRed. That's why I cooked up API-LLM-Hub ‚Äì a vanilla JavaScript library that lets you tap into various AI language model APIs right from your browser, no backend required.

## What's in the Box?

API-LLM-Hub is like that Swiss Army knife you always wished you had for static-page AI development (because who doesn't dream about that, right?). Here's what you're getting:

1. **Browser Besties**: This thing runs directly in your browser. No server-side shenanigans required!
2. **CORS Conqueror**: I nearly cried dealing with Anthropic's bizarre API examples‚Äîespecially since they don't have any for CORS issues!
3. **Multi-AI Handling**: Switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, TogetherAI, and Google's Gemini.
4. **Vanilla JS Goodness**: No fancy frameworks or build steps. Just pure, unadulterated JavaScript joy.

## An Example I Wish I'd Seen Before Starting This Stupic Project

```html
<script type="module">
  import APILLMHub from 'https://amanpriyanshu.github.io/API-LLM-Hub/unified-llm-api.js';

  async function runTest() {
    const ai = new APILLMHub({
      provider: 'openai',
      apiKey: 'your-api-key',
      model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
    });

    await ai.initialize();
    const response = await ai.sendMessage("Hello, AI!");
    console.log(response);
  }

  runTest();
</script>
```

That's it. Seriously. You're now conversing with an AI in your browser.

## Why You'll Love It (and Why Your Browser Will Too)

1. **Static Site Sorcery**: GitHub Pages? Netlify? No problem. API-LLM-Hub plays nice with all your favorite static hosts.
2. **AI Provider Roulette**: AI Provider Roulette: Switch between AI providers with a single line of code‚Äîwell, actually a function call... okay, maybe just one variable (`provider`), and possibly another (`model`).

## Real-World Magic (Because static pages are just crying out for embedded chatbots, aren't they?)

You can now integrate any static page with a chatbot using the user's API keys or add some LLM flair to your browser extension. Since I worked on implementing semantic search over recent YC startup batches in [YC-Dendrolinguistics](https://amanpriyanshu.github.io/YC-Dendrolinguistics/) (I highly recommend checking out the [Startup Linguistic Trees blog](https://amanpriyanshu.github.io/blogs/posts/2024/startup-linguistic-trees/)), combining that search with this system could easily implement RAGs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) on static webpages‚Äîwhich is both crazy and stupid. With API-LLM-Hub, you're only limited by your imagination (and maybe your API usage limits‚Äîbut that's a problem for future you).

## Wrapping Up

And there you have it, folks‚ÄîAPI-LLM-Hub in all its simplicity. It's a small step towards making LLM-API integration on static pages a bit simpler and a lot more fun. Give it a try!
