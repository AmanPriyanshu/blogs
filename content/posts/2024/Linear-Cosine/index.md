# LinearCosine: When AI Researchers Decided Multiplication was Too Mainstream

Hey there, optimization seekers and efficiency enthusiasts! ðŸ“ŠðŸ§® Today, we're diving into a world where even basic arithmetic operations are up for debate. Buckle up as we explore [LinearCosine, an experiment that asks: "Do we really need multiplication for AI?"](https://amanpriyanshu.github.io/LinearCosine/)

## The Paper That Started It All

During my fall break, while I was supposed to be relaxing, my roommate Yash Maurya forwarded me a fascinating paper by Hongyin Luo and Wei Sun titled "[Addition is All You Need for Energy-efficient Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00907)". I was immediately intrigued by their approach to modify one of the core fundamental computations in AI, multiplication. This project builds upon my previous work on [in-browser vanilla js semantic search, such as YC-Dendrolinguistics](https://amanpriyanshu.github.io/blogs/posts/2024/startup-linguistic-trees/), where I implemented a [cosine similarity-based information retrieval system for YC startups](https://amanpriyanshu.github.io/YC-Dendrolinguistics/). LinearCosine takes this a step further by exploring ways to make these fundamental calculations more energy-efficient.

## What is LinearCosine?

LinearCosine is my experimental project to explore the potential of the [L-Mul algorithm for energy-efficient cosine similarity calculations](https://amanpriyanshu.github.io/LinearCosine/). Here's what it's all about:

1. **L-Mul Algorithm Implementation**: Adapting Luo and Sun's approach for cosine similarity.
2. **Cosine Similarity Optimization**: Applying this method to a common calculation in AI and ML.
3. **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: Rigorously testing the performance against traditional methods.

## The Math Behind the Madness

Let's break down the key mathematical concepts:

### Standard Floating-Point Multiplication

The traditional method multiplies two floating-point numbers as follows:

```
Mul(x,y) = (1 + x_m) * 2^(x_e) * (1 + y_m) * 2^(y_e) = (1 + x_m + y_m + x_m * y_m) * 2^(x_e + y_e)
```

Where `x_m` and `y_m` are mantissas, and $x_e$ and $y_e$ are exponents.

### L-Mul Algorithm

The L-Mul method approximates this multiplication:

```
L-Mul(x,y) = (1 + x_m + y_m + 2^(-l(m))) * 2^(x_e + y_e)
```

Where `l(m)` is defined as:

```
l(m) = m if m â‰¤ 3
l(m) = 3 if m = 4
l(m) = 4 if m > 4
```

Here, `m` represents the number of mantissa bits.

## The Experiment

In LinearCosine, I implemented the L-Mul algorithm and applied it to cosine similarity calculations. I then conducted extensive benchmarking to compare its performance and accuracy against traditional floating-point multiplication.

## Results: Efficiency Meets Accuracy

Here's what I found:

1. **1D to 1D Cosine Similarity**: 
   - Average time reduction: 24.55%
   - Average L-Mul MSE: 1.9184e-05

2. **1D to 2D Cosine Similarity**:
   - Time reductions ranging from 16.8% to 18.6%

3. **2D to 2D Cosine Similarity**:
   - Time reductions between 21.88% and 23.12%

## Implications and Potential

These results open up some interesting possibilities:

1. **Performance Boost**: The consistent speed improvements could translate to significant efficiency gains in large-scale AI operations.
2. **Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-off**: While there's a slight loss in accuracy, it's within acceptable limits for many AI applications.
3. **Energy Efficiency Potential**: The reduced computation time hints at possible energy savings, though this would need further investigation on actual hardware.

## Limitations and Considerations

It's important to acknowledge the limitations of this experiment:

1. This is a simplified implementation and may not capture all nuances of the original proposal.
2. The benchmarks focus on raw computation time, which doesn't directly translate to energy efficiency in real-world scenarios.
3. Results may vary significantly in different hardware environments or more complex applications.

## Future Directions

This experiment opens up several exciting avenues for further exploration:

1. **Hardware-Specific Implementation**: Testing on specialized hardware could provide more realistic efficiency metrics and potentially uncover even greater performance gains.
2. **Detailed Energy Consumption Analysis**: Conducting studies with actual energy consumption measurements to quantify the potential energy savings in real-world scenarios.
3. **Optimization for Different Precision Levels**: Investigating how the L-Mul algorithm performs under different precision requirements and optimizing it for specific use cases.
4. **Integration with Existing AI Frameworks**: Exploring ways to integrate this approach into popular AI frameworks to make it more accessible to researchers and practitioners.
