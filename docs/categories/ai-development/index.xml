The Topic Modeling Challenge You know that feeling when you have 50 browser tabs open, and you&amp;rsquo;re desperately trying to organize them into bookmark folders? &amp;ldquo;ML Papers To Read,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Funny Cat Videos,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Recipes I&amp;rsquo;ll Never Make&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; We all have our system. And apparently, it&amp;rsquo;s such a universal problem that every tech company is launching their own solution - Arc Browser with its &amp;ldquo;Spaces,&amp;rdquo; Chrome with its tab groups, and about 500 extensions promising to color-code your digital hoarding habits into submission.</description>

Well, buckle up, because we&amp;rsquo;re about to dive into a similar realm of &amp;ldquo;What was I thinking?&amp;rdquo; – the saga of AdaptKeyBERT.
It&amp;rsquo;s been two trips around the sun since I cobbled together this quirky little keyword extractor and sent it off into the wild world of NLP.</description>
