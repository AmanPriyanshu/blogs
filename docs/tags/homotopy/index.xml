      <description>The last few posts have all been of relatively long length and have all taken some time to construct and write. I initially also wanted to produce shorter posts just discussing an example or a calculation etc, and today I tried to do just that, but failed. The post became somewhat longer than intended, but it is really informal and intuitive, so its fine in my opinion.
In a previous post we discussed both weak homotopy equivalences and regular homotopy equivalences, and we have also encountered the Whitehead theorem, which says that any weak homotopy equivalence between CW-complexes is in fact a regular homotopy equivalence.</description>

      <title>The homotopy category</title>

      <description>This is part 9 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7 and 8.
Last time we ended by giving a definition of a homotopy between maps on the collection of bifibrant objects in a model category. Today we are going to expand further upon this idea, and try to build the theory we are familiar with for topological spaces but in the general setting.</description>

      <title>Homotopy in model categories</title>

      <description>This is part 8 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7 and 9.
Last time we finally defined the model category, gave some examples and tried (kind of) to give a motivation to why they are interesting and how they set the stage for homotopy theory. The first time I read the definition I was a bit confused about the lack of mention of homotopy, or at least some prototype of it that I could connect with.</description>

      <title>Hanging Pictures With Homotopy</title>

      <description>Some time ago I saw this problem of hanging a picture on the wall using a string and two nails in such a way that if you remove one of the nails from the wall, the picture falls down. This is a bad way to hang pictures you immediately say, and I would agree. I saw some solution to the problem, and didnâ€™t think about it for many years, until this week when I figured out that we need homotopy, in particular the fundamental group, to do it!</description>

      <title>Fibrations</title>

      <description>This is part 1 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7, 8 and 9.
My main mathematical interest for the last couple years has been algebraic topology. I feel it suits my needs for intuition, and graphical picturing of what happens. A concept I have been learning more rigorously recently is fibrations, and how to use them in computing homotopy groups and homology groups of different spaces.</description>
