The Topic Modeling Challenge You know that feeling when you have 50 browser tabs open, and you&amp;rsquo;re desperately trying to organize them into bookmark folders? &amp;ldquo;ML Papers To Read,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Funny Cat Videos,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Recipes I&amp;rsquo;ll Never Make&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; We all have our system. And apparently, it&amp;rsquo;s such a universal problem that every tech company is launching their own solution - Arc Browser with its &amp;ldquo;Spaces,&amp;rdquo; Chrome with its tab groups, and about 500 extensions promising to color-code your digital hoarding habits into submission.</description>

When it comes to topic extraction, the AI world seems fixated on massive models and expensive compute. But what if there was a simpler way? ðŸ¤”
The Genesis: Simplicity Through Linear Transformation Picture this: There I was, looking for an open-source solution to extract topics from text at scale. The available options were either massive language models or complex fine-tuning pipelines. That&amp;rsquo;s when it hit me â€“ what if we could leverage the semantic structure of existing embeddings with just a linear transformation?</description>
