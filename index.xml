      <description>The first post on this blog is titled &amp;ldquo;geometric intuition&amp;rdquo;, and discusses the geometry behind Noether&amp;rsquo;s normalization lemma. When I wrote it I didn&amp;rsquo;t yet understand all the pieces, as I was not very comfortable working with algebraic geometry. One year later, I&amp;rsquo;m still not comfortable, but a bit more than last year. So, I thought I would update last years post with my new knowledge, as well as generalize the intuition to schemes - which we introduced in the last post.</description>

      <description>The first two posts ([1],[2]) I ever did on this blog - now over a year ago - were posts about algebraic geometry. In particular we explored the geometric implications of some of the algebraic results I was learning in my commutative algebra class. Last summer I also wrote a post about sheaves, and left it off by claiming to soon write about schemes. If you scroll through the blog we have covered a bunch of different topics, but the blog post on schemes, seems to have fallen through the cracks.</description>

      <description>For those that don’t know I am a fifth year mathematics student at NTNU, meaning I am finishing my masters degree after this semester. During my time at NTNU I have had some wonderful classes, and some wonderful teachers. Since most I post about on this blog is related to topology, it is very safe to assume that some of my most memorable courses are exactly the topology courses. I very recently looked at my notes from my first topology course, or rather one of the two first, as I took two in parallel during my fourth semester.</description>

      <description>For quite some time I have occasionally stumbled onto the Wikipedia page for orbifolds while looking at topology related mathematics. I have always been fascinated by them, and always though that they certainly will come up during studies at university, but they never have (at least not yet). On said wikipedia page it says that the word orbifold is short for “orbit manifold” and that these orbifolds are in fact a generalization of manifolds.</description>

      <description>This summer I’m participating in Ravi Vakils pseudocourse on algebraic geometry, AGITTOC. Hence this summer serves as a wonderful opportunity to learn and write about cool mathematics. For long I have wanted to dive deeper into this abstract topic after just dipping my toes in during my bachelor thesis, and now it is time. Ravi though us in the first lecture that we shouldn’t study abstract objects without a cause, i.</description>

      <description>A part of mathematics I really an starting to enjoy more is mathematics that explain or develop connections between geometry or topology, and algebra. The first two posts on this blog was focused on developing some geometrical insight to two lemmas from commutative algebra, namely Noether’s normalization lemma and Zariski’s lemma. There are many more such connections worth discussing and exploring, and today I want to focus on one of these “bridges” between geometry and algebra, namely Swan’s theorem.</description>

      <description>This is part 9 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7 and 8.
Last time we ended by giving a definition of a homotopy between maps on the collection of bifibrant objects in a model category. Today we are going to expand further upon this idea, and try to build the theory we are familiar with for topological spaces but in the general setting.</description>

      <description>This is part 8 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7 and 9.
Last time we finally defined the model category, gave some examples and tried (kind of) to give a motivation to why they are interesting and how they set the stage for homotopy theory. The first time I read the definition I was a bit confused about the lack of mention of homotopy, or at least some prototype of it that I could connect with.</description>

      <description>This is part 7 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 8 and 9.
Finally we have made it to the destination we set, namely, more abstraction. This post is focused on the definition and intuition on model categories, which abstracts the objects we have been studying for some weeks, namely fibrations and cofibrations. The main definition is that of a model structure on a category, which together with a nice category will form the definition of a model category.</description>

      <description>This is part 6 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 7, 8 and 9.
Through the series so far we have covered the basic uses of fibrations and related things, like the long exact sequence of homotopy groups, the Serre spectral sequence, fiber bundles and homotopy groups of spheres. But, we have not mentioned that fibrations has a dual construct, namely cofibrations.</description>

      <description>This is part 5 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
As promised in the previous part, we are going to calculate $\pi_4(S^3)$. I think we will have to use all of the machinery (plus some new) that we have been through during this series to do the calculation. What more could we possibly need you ask?</description>

      <description>This is part 4 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 3, 5 6, 7, 8 and 9.
My personal favorite part about fibrations is that they come equipped with a natural way to compute the cohomology of the total space from the cohomology of the base and the cohomology of the fibers. This process is encoded in a structure called a spectral sequence, and is a complicated object in its full generality.</description>

For an introduction to the material, the definitions, motivation and some examples, please read part 1 and part 2 about fibrations and fiber bundles. This and the the following parts of this series will be about their usefulness, especially in computing homology and homotopy groups.</description>

      <description>This is part 2 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 3, 4, 5 6, 7, 8 and 9.
Yesterday we discussed the standard definition of a fibration by the homotopy lifting property, and today we are continuing that discussion, but in a more visual manner. This we will do by first looking at fiber bundles, and then generalizing them. Since fibrations are generalized fiber bundles, every fiber bundle is an example of a fibration, and they have been the most important examples for me, as they help me visualize and get intuition into the fibrations without having to really use the full generality of the definition.</description>

      <description>This is part 1 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7, 8 and 9.
My main mathematical interest for the last couple years has been algebraic topology. I feel it suits my needs for intuition, and graphical picturing of what happens. A concept I have been learning more rigorously recently is fibrations, and how to use them in computing homotopy groups and homology groups of different spaces.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I wrote a geometric explanation of Noether’s normalization lemma, which you can find here. I’m going to use the geometric machinery developed in that post, so it can be useful to read that first.
One useful result that is often stated as a corollary to Noether’s normalization lemma is Zariski’s lemma. It is a corollary of the algebraic form of the normalization lemma, so i thought there ought to be a geometric version of it as well, which I think I have found.</description>

      <description>Introduction This spring I have been taking a graduate class in commutative algebra, and I have yet to do algebraic geometry in a proper way, and have only gotten a small taste while writing my bachelor thesis. So this entire semester, I have felt this hinting at a geometric picture from the algebra itself, but i didn&amp;rsquo;t have the insight to figure it out. That said, I now think I have the geometric picture for Noether normalization, which in term implies a geometric picture of Hilbert nullstellensatz and some other results.</description>
